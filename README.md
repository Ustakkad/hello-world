# hello-world
Starting my first repository. New here.

Hello everyone, Ustakkad here. I'm brand new to Github and fairly new to programming and other tech feilds. I've been wanting to branch into the Tech area for a long time, but never had the actual time to do it, until I just stopped doing everything else and started up school in a computer science bachelors. I'm partway through now and looking to get much deeper understanding about programming and other things like game design, which I'm really looking into being a focus for myself. A friend told me that I need to get on here and start perusing the site, so now I'm here.
